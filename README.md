# DATA ANALYST

This repository contains the work of the Data Analyst project, which includes both personal and group contributions.


## Personal Work

### Project 1: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Handling raw data by MySQL)
### Using Tech layoffs dataset from COVID 2019 to present.
One of the primary tasks within personal work is domain testing. Domain testing involves examining specific aspects of the software's functionality to ensure it aligns with the intended domain or industry. In this project, we focus on domain testing for the OrangeHRM website.
### Handling duplicates and standardizing data. Looking at null values and removing any columns and rows that are not necessary.
Automation testing is another key personal responsibility. This entails creating automated test scripts and harnesses to assess the functionality and performance of the OrangeHRM website. Automation testing helps increase efficiency and accuracy in the testing process.
### Exploring the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers.


## Group Work

### Project 2: Data Exploration (Exploring datasets by WEKA software)
### Lab01: Data Preprocessing and Data exploration
Hands-on exploring data through the application of support tools provided by the open-source
software WEKA and preprocessing data in Python.
### Lab02: Frequent itemset mining
Find combinations of items (itemsets) that occur frequently using Apriori algorithm and Tree Projection


### Project 3: Financial Fraud Analysis - Using Anomaly Detection Techniques (Building Machine Leaning Models to Detect Anomalies)
### Training Ensemble Models for Anomaly Detection
Using SMOTE technique to handle the imblanced dataset.  
### Evaluating
Using the Confusion Matrix and PR-AUC metric of the models for Hyperparameter tuning.
